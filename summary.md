This app fits Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model to historical price data and uses the model to make a probabilistic forecast. In addition, multiple hypothetical future scenarios are generated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations based on the GBM model. The results are plotted below, and you can use widgets in the side-panel to interact with the figure. Scroll down for forecast interpretation, modeling details, and sources of historical price data.
