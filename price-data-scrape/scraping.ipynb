    "\n",
    "[CarbonNews](https://www.carbonnews.co.nz/) is described as \"New Zealand’s only daily news service covering the carbon markets, climate change, sustainable business and the growth of the low-carbon economy\". It is a private business, so to read the published stories in full one must pay a subscription fee, but some useful information can be gleaned from headlines and short text snippets without paying for subscription. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [Jarden NZ Market Report](https://www.carbonnews.co.nz/tag.asp?tag=Jarden+NZ+Market+Report) section contains stories with updates on the daily price of NZUs traded on [CommTrade](https://www.commtrade.co.nz/). Each story (such as [this](https://www.carbonnews.co.nz/story.asp?storyID=28274) one) reports on the latest \"fixing\", i.e. spot price, as well as the opening bid and offer prices. The spot price is quoted in the story's heading, while the opening bid and offer prices are quoted in the story's first paragraph, which is visible to non-subscribers. \n",

    "In general, data scraping involves parsing the HTML source code of a web page of interest, and in the present case we have two to begin with: [Jarden NZ Market Report](https://www.carbonnews.co.nz/tag.asp?tag=Jarden+NZ+Market+Report) and its [archive](https://www.carbonnews.co.nz/tagarchive.asp?tag=Jarden+NZ+Market+Report). These two web pages contain all the information required to produce the desired CSV file, but if we also wanted to include the opening bid and offer price values in the CSV file, or if we needed to check that the spot price written in the headline actually features in the story's first paragraph, then we would need to find and parse the web page for each and every story individually, and there are more than a thousand stories in the archive.

    "## Inspection using browser\n",
    "From simply looking at the [Jarden NZ Market Report](https://www.carbonnews.co.nz/tag.asp?tag=Jarden+NZ+Market+Report) web page in a browser we see a listing of stories, each with a clickable headline, a brief text summary, and a graph. Most (if not all) of the headlines state the spot price of NZUs, and each accompanying summary begins with the date when the story was published. Somewhat inconveniently, the date formatting is variable: showing just \"Today\" or the appropriate weekday for stories that are less than a week old, and the date in full (e.g. \"25 Jul 23\") only for older stories.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Report_h1h2.png)\n",
    "![](./Report_h2h3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspecting the HTML source reveals that the central listing of stories is associated with a `<div>` element of class `\"StoryList\"`. Inside this element, the latest headline in the listing is associated with the element tagged by `<h1>`, the following six headlines are each tagged by `<h2>`, and the remaining ones by `<h3>`; but all these headline elements have the same class name `\"Headline\"` attributed to them. Inside each and every headline element there is an `<a>` element with an `href` attribute (defining a hyperlink to the full story), and the actual headline text is nested inside this `<a>` element. Furthermore, each and every headline element is followed by an accompanying `<p>` element containing the story's brief summary.       \n",
    "\n",
    "Inspection of [Jarden NZ Market Report Archive](https://www.carbonnews.co.nz/tagarchive.asp?tag=Jarden+NZ+Market+Report) shows continuation of the same general pattern: first twenty stories in the archive are associated with `<h3>` elements (containing the headline) and accompanying `<p>` elements (containing the summary); and all older stories are associated with `<h4>` elements (without any accompanying `<p>` elements). For these older archived stories, the full date is embedded in the corresponding `<h4>` element but outside the internal `<a>` element.\n",
