The NZU price history was scraped from [Jarden NZ Market Report](https://www.carbonnews.co.nz/tag.asp?tag=Jarden+NZ+Market+Report), and the data for EUA was taken from the Europen Energy Exchage (EEX) [Primary Auction Spot Download webpage](https://www.eex.com/en/market-data/environmental-markets/eua-primary-auction-spot-download). Copies of both datasets used in this app are regularly updated and resampled to produce weekly averaged time-series.
